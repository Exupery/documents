# Operation Code Board Director Job Description

At Operation Code, we're on a mission to get active military, citizen-soldiers, veterans and military spouses coding and building software to change the world and fill the nation's technical talent shortage with our nation's finest. Our members are based both CONUS and OCONUS with over 1,800 members in our Slack community (and, growing!), over 40 software engineering mentors, and an all-volunteer staff scaling growth and managing day-to-day operations all in a remote and decentralized operating environment - the Internet.

As a board member, you'll have the honor and privilege of having a seat at the table in building an veterans service organization unlike any other anywhere, focused on introducing our nation's finest to web technologies to code the future. Still interested? Read on my friend.

## Duties & Responsibilities

As a board director,

- You'll lead with velocity and due diligence on board committees, and take on additional special assignments based on your skills & abilities. It's not a full-time job (we all have one), but this can be rough if you've never served on a charity nonprofit working board. That said, we encourage newbies as we prepare you for the challenge of your life in growing, ahem, a startup nonprofit all in a challenging, fast-paced environment.

- You'll serve as an ambassador and have meetings with senior government officials, including Members of Congress (including, permanent staff), and senior private-sector leaders to explore new opportunities and strategic partnerships for the organization to capitalize and leverage. Our team has already testified before a Congressional briefing and participated in an House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on modernizing post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to meet the needs of today's veterans. The bar is being set ever higher and you'll help be responsible for removing barriers so we can go higher.

- You'll serve as a top-level development officer, and help plan and participate in online and offline fundraisers, including the annual fundraiser, Facebook donate campaigns, employer-employee matching, and evangelize Amazon Smile--all designed to bring in financial capital to staff our programs & services. We don't expect you to know everything there is about grants, but we do expect you to give of your personal wallet, a donation from your company, or coordinate access to capital. Once an intro is made, the leadership team can follow-up and take it from there.

- You'll serve as a branding marketer and take on every available opportunity to share our members' success stories to the media, educating at every chance to build rapport, trust and excite everyone about our work, and the challenges we face. Remember, everyone loves a good story.

- You'll serve as an strategist, providing advice and input to the leadership team to think through our tools (bots), open source projects, and operational processes to automate some of our work, better align resources, and explore new ways of executing. Army 52 alpha? Keep reading.

- You'll serve as an business operator, helping the leadership team improve our business models while envisioning new business models that lead to better and more expeditious delivery of services nationally and internationally, wherever our members are located. We move fast, prepare yourself.

- You'll serve as our spokesperson at conferences, helping recruit new software engineers to volunteer as mentors, new hiring partners to hire our members, and volunteers to help us go further, faster. We even have care packages, including cute little stickers, tri-folds, and a banner (when we're tabling) that our community team can send to your hotel so you can truly represent our colors. We bleed Operation Code and we would expect nothing less.

- You'll serve as a sounding board, listening, participating and engaging our members during our bi-weekly townhalls. These conference calls are unique, informative and in your face, because you'll hear directly from those we're serving, what their challenges are as well as their programming pursuits, as well as the community team that manages this growth. It's intense and insane at the same time. We don't expect you to be on every townhall, but it would be inspiring to honor us with your presence on these calls.

- You'll live and breath the challenges and aspirations of our members, coming up with solutions to resolve the issues they face. As a startup nonprofit, you'll work directly with the front-lines, from operations to community, to ensure you have the ammunition to fire on all cylinders and get us to the finish line. We're all here to get stuff done. And, we'll hold each other to it.
