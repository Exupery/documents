e) Chief executive report. Molina reports that:
- At the national level, we were accepted into our first accelerator at [MassChallenge](http://boston.masschallenge.org/press-release/masschallenge-boston-announces-2017-cohort) in Boston, Mass. The team is led by Conrad Hollomon. This is leading to our first physical group working together on a number of deliverables, including open source, partnerships and advocacy.
- On the legislative front, we're continuing to work with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on the [VET TEC Act](https://www.majorityleader.gov/2017/04/06/vet-tec/), a piece of legislation he introduced to bring more tech education to veterans via coding bootcamps. More at: [vettec.operationcode.org/](https://vettec.operationcode.org/). On the same front, we've been invited to Capitol Hill twice and we have a small policy team now supporting this ongoing effort in Michael Bell and Janine Medina, and several letters have gone out to advocate for more streamlined tech education access.  
- [OperationCode.org](https://operationcode.org/) has finally migrated from a full Ruby on Rails application to a Rails ([back-end](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend/graphs/contributors)) and React ([front-end](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_frontend/graphs/contributors)) with over 25 contributors on the project and exposing more veterans/spouses to open source as a result. [More on the project](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode).
- On the fundraising side, the Governor's Ballroom at the Sentinel Hotel in Portland, Ore. has been booked for Friday, November 10, 2017 on what will become our signature fundraiser. A landing has been created for sponsors and for companies to buy a table and a planning committee is in place. More at: [operationcode.org/gala](https://operationcode.org/gala).

Plan is to have board members arrive Thursday, 11/9/2017, dinner and check into hotel with physical board meeting morning of 11/10/2017. On monies raised, intent is to take minimum $100,000 raised (or 60-80%) and create the Operation Code Scholarship Endowment through the Oregon Community Foundation and thus we can award scholarships for conferences, travel and code schools without ever exhausting monies raised. In talks to hire an event planner.
- On the same topic, we've contracted fundraising counsel to work with the leadership team, and a Development Director is working with our team on corporate and foundation grants. We recently received our first corporate donation.
- On software mentorship, we continue to pair veterans/spouses with volunteer software engineers and we've seen incredible growth from not just engineers based in the U.S., but abroad. Additionally, we're seeing our end-to-end veterans services flourish with veterans who previously were one of our first members and today mentoring the next generation.
- On scholarships, 38 of our members were just enrolled in Udacity for Front-End, Android and Intro to Programming with lots of excitement and engagement. We've been able to partner with code schools across the country to leverage veterans/spouses scholarship-- we expect this to continue as well as scholarships and conferences. These scholarship announcements continue in both the [#general](https://operation-code.slack.com/messages/general) and [#coding-schools](https://operation-code.slack.com/messages/coding-schools) channels.
- On employer services, we continue to help our members in the [#job_board](https://operation-code.slack.com/messages/job_board), and our members continue to receive great guidance from their mentors. Our [form for members to request a mentor is here](http://op.co.de/mentor-request).
- On hardware issuance, we've been able to issue out both desktop and PC laptops to our members to start learning to code. A major request, we plan on [growing this program](https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_frontend/issues/72) as it's been an invaluable service to our members nationally with some interest on [social media](https://twitter.com/bketelsen/status/875815943284424704).
- On code schools, PDX Code Guild has been the latest code school to receive GI Bill approval, however, we've also seen state and federal burdensome regulations shutter tech education-- Texas-based, Guild of Software Architects was the latest creating a massive void in iOS/Android training. We continue to work with code school directors across the country on regulatory & compliance and expect to increase our efforts through end of year, and in that spirit signed onto the [Council on Integrity in Results Reporting's (CIRR)](http://cirr.org/), a coalition to commit to code school standardized results reporting and truth in advertising.

Discussion. Davis asked Molina about state-to-state GI Bill approval. Molina shared that all code schools still continue to wait 2-years before submitting for GI Bill approval, and then wait 3-6 months for a state approval visit and then another few months for GI Bill approval, all despite a code school being in existence for several years and growing demand to fill tech jobs. The regulatory paperwork continues to be lengthy and not every state is as friendly as say Oregon and Washington.

In all, a $19m budget is shared between all 50 states and 4 territories, thus making it incredibly difficult for a state like California's code schools to become GI Bill eligible when there is 7 officials for the entire state school infrastructure. In addition, Molina shared that current federal rules prohibit online tech education such as Treehouse, Udacity, One Month Rails, and CodeSchool.com to accept GI Bill/military education benefits for service members to learn while still on active-duty, however, Molina shared that is a key policy action item for the D.C. team.

f) Review and comment on 5-Year Strategic Policy (2017-2021). In the interest of time, Ciszek moves to table to next board meeting. Unanimous consent, motion passes.

## VI. General Announcements
- Ensure photos/bios are submitted via email or Slack. The goal is for the  for [operationcode.org](https://wwww.operationcode.org).

## VII. Adjournment
Ciszek adjourned the meeting at 11:12am PST. Minutes submitted by: Ciszek, Secretary-elect.
