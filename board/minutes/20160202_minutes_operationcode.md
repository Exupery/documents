## IV. Reports
a) Chief Executive’s Report
- Molina reports on IRS application. Not completed, yet. Expects the application completed NLT 15 Feb. Call w/ legislative aides on streamlining VA accreditation for code schools went well. Kerr and Gómez also joined call. Provided numerous recommendations. Scholarship partnerships with Flatiron and Bloc.io. On Learn, 82 vets signed up, 4 enrolled. Code Fellows has diversity scholarship for military veterans. Scholarship Chair, Nell Shamrell, coordinating scholarship inbound/outbound requests. Sabio.la expects New GI Bill (via Antioch) in spring. Media coverage, including GeekWire, TechCrunch. On finances, asked Pete to be 2nd signer on bank account.

Discussion: Runyon on IRS application, more communication with CPA to meet deadline. Emphasize importance of deadline 15 Feb. From development perspective, being prevented from growing and taking different steps without 501(c)(3). Ensure next time: importance of
launching. 15 Feb is send-off date. Kerr concurs on importance of deadline. Otherwise, will personally take over application filing.

b) Finances
Runyon re-emphasizes need to launch IRS application. Need to emphasize
in our discussions with potential funders that we have an IRS application in process to ensure validity. Methods for collecting donations from people. Folks asking about WWP and how we’re going to be different, transparent. Need to implement limits on salaries, limits on operational expenses. Example, average medium income based on county, state. Would like to engage board on how to structure. How we handle donations? Private donations. Potentially a code school sponsor vs. personal donations. So for example, administrative costs vs. 100% set-aside scholarships. Ex. Jane Doe donates $100, and all goes to veterans online.

Molina concurs and agrees to work with Runyon on updating site to make more clear on the language. Kerr concurs, just need to stick with it, organizationally. As long as we have both covers, we’re good. May hamper us if we don’t pull in corporate donations. Example, max. percentage. Runyon adds so long as restrictions doesn't conflict or hamper IRS application. Kerr doesn't believe it would be an issue.

Gómez, need to talk about larger financial goals. The need to articulate fundraising organizationally and methods/channels for driving revenue. Runyon adds that fundraising is back of our mind, but once 501(c)(3) is secured, develop clear view of donor strategy, and
larger fundraising plans, including donors and grants.  

Thomas suggests making Form 990 avail online, and ensuring watchdog organizations, including Guidestar, know we exist. Ensure we're added to organizations that rank all veterans organizations, example rated-A, and how they are distributed.

Gómez makes clear, once 501(c)(3) is secured we need be going at full-speed and ensure staffing needs are met and Molina is paid for his time running the organization. Urges board members to think about fundraising committee sooner rather than later, and begin developing fundraising plans individually and as a board now. Kerr asks board to shoot for a President's Day press release on IRS application submittal.

Molina asks Gómez based on personal experience whether to put together a Fundraising Committee now as we’re putting together an IRS application, or after once the IRS approves Operation Code as tax-exempt? From personal experience, Gómez believes sooner rather than later because fundraising and nurturing donor relations takes a lot of time. Now is better. Be happy to lead that effort as Fundraising Committee Chair.

Kerr concurs now would be better. Targeting and strategically looking at the big picture. Kerr suggests looking into the Business Executives for National Security (BENS) might be good for bouncing ideas. Would connect with BENS and explore possibilities.

Molina thanks Gómez for Chair of Fundraising Committee and strategic fundraising efforts. Gómez happy to lead strategic efforts and aligning ourselves with business leaders, both inside Silicon Valley and outside the Valley. Gómez on Fundraising Committee, suggests we talk to HackReactor, code schools and develop partnerships that create revenue. All code schools not just those in the Valley.

Molina asks Runyon to ensure Fundraising Committee is added to next agenda under Committee Reports. Runyon, two signatures on bank withdrawals. Runyon will add, and report next board meeting. Kerr concurs on setting up finance daily operations processes so that are no issues, establishing operational monetary thresholds, etc. Kerr asks Molina on others docs, Molina adds reimbursement and staffing forms.

c) Conference Spokeswoman
Knight not on the call.

d) Social media communication
Gómez recommends adding social media communication to reports. Kerr agrees that a communication plan necessary to share appropriately, between Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc. Gómez suggests one-day a week to share in social media, ex. importance of computer literacy. Example, every Monday. Molina recommends social media communication calendar and person to lead effort. Gómez suggests strategy on Twitter might be more effective due to reporters following, vs. Facebook more personal.

e) JAG Brigade
Kerr still recruiting attorney's. Still talking to HackReactor, Wincode Academy, 4Geek. HackReactor talked to Operation Code a while back. Going to regroup to a larger base of attorney’s and recruit outside of former JAGs. Gómez not clear on all JAG Brigade efforts (who, what, why) per site. Kerr emphasizes role to facilitate code schools VA accreditation paperwork. Molina asks whether exploring web technologies, ex. Twilio credits to facilitate JAG Brigade growth. Paredes adds, fairly easy to implement especially if attorney’s are pro-bono. Kerr adds attorney's will provide free service, adding all attorney’s have to do pro-bono and would work in our favor. Molina will work with Paredes to explore Twilio. Kerr adds that this might be problematic for attorney’s to take calls from an 800-number. Molina adds the need for marketing copy for JAG Brigade--will work with Kerr. Kerr emphasizes that JAG Brigade is paperwork focused. Down the road, valuable tool build to help entrepreneurs get off the ground with their technology products, projects and companies. Molina requests all board members to refer former JAGs or interested attorney's to Kerr as a next step.

f) PR/Marketing
Gómez pushed Molina to publish Medium post and gained great visibility, emphasizes importance for the founder's voice to come out in the Medium and Twitter community. Waiting on more fundraising to work PR/marketing. Hopefully by 1 March to push out more marketing, ex. Why Molina started Operation Code? Molina adds need to build out PR/marketing calendar. Frost volunteers to help build the Medium initiative. Thomas would like to help with analyzing metrics and measuring our impact. Frost to work with Thomas, Thomas to develop metrics and analyze.

g) Deploy
Molina shares quick update, web apprenticeship program. Three enrolled now, Ming Zhang, Krystyna Ewing and John Hampton. Developing first real-world client web application, SRVD. In the future charge clients, veterans organizations/veteran entrepreneurs. In the future, get VA accreditation to compensate apprentices while learning to write code.
