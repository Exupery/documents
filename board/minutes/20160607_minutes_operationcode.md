b) Development Committee report
- Kerr on the Veteran’s Day Fundraiser in SF to pay for growth in 2017. Board will handle the infrastructure, vision and lead planning with volunteers. Strategic level, board. Operational, JAG Brigade. Tactical level, staff.
- Aside from national fundraiser, regional and local fundraisers, ex. happy hour events, leading up to the national fundraiser. Another element, developing a Indiegogo product that fundraises for Operation Code, stickers, t-shirts, bringing in revenue and snowballing to the Nov fundraiser.
- Runyon, previous fundraiser goal was set at $7.5m, recommends we tailor the fundraiser towards aim for scholarships. Working on message for board, ex. what the money will support.
Kerr, more ambitious the better. Get the message first, and every event we organize aligns with the greater message and national fundraiser.
- Runyon, part of the message could be about strategic partnerships and matching funds/slots to specific code schools. Molina, should the board consider outside fundraising/event planning specialist to support event planning? Kerr, commission is not possible, but if we can aim to get a host sponsor that comes with event specialists.
- On the happy hour fundraiser, need to get our message this year, ex. concrete goal, with everything feeding into that, that narrative. Envisioning a JAG Brigade fundraiser and inviting the Miami Beach entrepreneur community (building local ties). On leave starting next week for a few weeks, returning a few days before 4th of July (might too close). Later in the summer might work. On messaging, needed. Focus should be on the big picture.
- Acknowledgement to Stefano needed on his help with JAG Brigade. Hunton & Williams could sponsor, buy table.
- Molina, who else is working messaging? Runyon, working with David Lim (Lim) on messaging, location, event plans. Molina, suggests enlisting a Civil Affairs/Psyop veteran, create black/white flyers and airdrop.
- Critical goal of messaging, Kerr, will work with Runyon, Lim and the board to get the event moving and pre-events/regional happy hours.
- Kerr, when we look at messaging be (Runyon) thinking about incorporating disabled veterans and women veterans.

Discussion:
Runyon, potentially open up a military veterans serving code school. Kerr, code schools is in the business plan and a long-term potentially, but need clearer picture on startup costs. Would like to see something smaller, ex. a program for Gold Star families, one week of coding 101 for their children. Molina will look into grants avail.

c) JAG Brigade
